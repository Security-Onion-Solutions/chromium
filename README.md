# chromium

Starting in Chromium 79, some users are experiencing 5-10 second hangs in Chromium.  This issue did not exist in Chromium 78.0.3904.108, so we are providing the Ubuntu packages for that version on the Releases tab of this repo.  No changes have been made to these standard Ubuntu packages.
